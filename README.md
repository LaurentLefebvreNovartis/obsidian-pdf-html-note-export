- **Embedded images** — Vault images are automatically converted to base64 for fully self-contained exports.
- **Metadata header** — Title, export date, and frontmatter tags displayed at the top.
- **Custom CSS** — Add your own CSS overrides via plugin settings.
- **File menu integration** — Right-click any `.md` file → Export as PDF / HTML5.
